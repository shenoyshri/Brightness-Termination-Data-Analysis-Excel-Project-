# Workforce Attrition Forecasting & Termination Analysis
📌 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes employee termination data for Brightness, a hypermarket chain, to evaluate workforce exit patterns and project future termination trends.

The objective was to translate structured HR business questions into data-driven insights using Microsoft Excel, including projection modelling, classification logic, and scenario analysis.

🎯 **Business Objectives**

  * Calculate total employee terminations in 2020
  
  * Project 2021 terminations based on a 7% global growth rate assumption
  
  * Perform sensitivity analysis (4%–10% growth scenarios)
  
  * Identify dominant termination reasons
  
  * Categorize terminations into Voluntary and Involuntary
  
  * Calculate percentage distribution of voluntary exits
  
  * Classify terminated employees by experience level

🗂 **Dataset**

* Source: Brightness_Termination_Data.xlsx

* Format: Excel (.xlsx)

* Key Fields:

    * Employee Details
    
    * Termination Status
    
    * Termination Reason
    
    * Hire Date & Termination Date
    
    * Tenure (Years of Service)

🛠 **Tools & Skills Applied**

  * Microsoft Excel
  
  * Pivot Tables
  
  * IF / OR Logical Functions
  
  * COUNTIF / SUMIF
  
  * Growth Rate Projection Formula
  
  * Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis
  
  * Percentage & Distribution Calculations
  
  * Data Cleaning & Structuring

📈 **Analysis Performed**

  1️⃣ Termination Trend Calculation
  
  Calculated total number of employee terminations in 2020.
  
  2️⃣ Termination Projection (2021 Forecast)
  
  Projected 2021 terminations using a 7% growth rate assumption:
  
  Projection = 2020 Terminations × (1 + Growth Rate)
  
  3️⃣ Sensitivity Analysis
  
  Evaluated projected terminations across growth scenarios ranging from 4% to 10% (0.5% increments) to understand potential risk exposure.
  
  4️⃣ Termination Reason Analysis
  
  Created summary tables to evaluate total terminations by:
  
  * Retirement
  
  * Resignation
  
  * Layoff
  
  Identified dominant exit drivers.
  
  5️⃣ Voluntary vs Involuntary Classification
  
  Developed conditional logic to categorize:
  
  Retirement & Resignation → Voluntary
  
  Layoff → Involuntary
  
  Calculated percentage share of voluntary exits.
  
  6️⃣ Experience-Level Segmentation
  
  Classified employees based on tenure:
  
  * 0–5 Years → Newcomer
      
  * 6–10 Years → Proficient
      
  * 10+ Years → Expert
  
  Analyzed exit distribution across experience groups.

🔍 **Key Insights**

  * Identified dominant termination reasons impacting workforce stability
  
  * Evaluated projected workforce risk under varying growth assumptions
  
  * Quantified voluntary vs involuntary exit proportions
  
  * Highlighted tenure-based exit distribution patterns

💡 **Business Value**

This analysis demonstrates how structured Excel modelling can support:

  * Workforce planning
  
  * HR risk forecasting
  
  * Scenario-based decision making
  
  * Exit trend monitoring

🚀**Learnings & Takeaways**

  * Strengthened Excel-based forecasting and logical modelling
  
  * Improved ability to translate business questions into structured analytical outputs
  
  * Developed sensitivity analysis techniques for scenario planning
